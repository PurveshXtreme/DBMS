**Q1: What is a Database Management System (DBMS)? What are its types, advantages, and applications?**

**Answer:**
A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software used to efficiently manage and organize databases. It provides an interface for storing, retrieving, updating, and managing data while ensuring **data integrity**, **security**, and **concurrency control**. Examples include **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Oracle**, and **SQL Server**.

**Types of DBMS:**
1. **Hierarchical DBMS** – Organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.  
   *Example:* IBM IMS  
2. **Network DBMS** – Represents data as a graph with many-to-many relationships.  
   *Example:* Integrated Data Store (IDS)  
3. **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)** – Stores data in tables (relations) and manages it using SQL.  
   *Example:* MySQL, PostgreSQL  
4. **Object-Oriented DBMS** – Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming.  
   *Example:* ObjectDB  

**Advantages of DBMS:**
- **Data Integrity:** Maintains accuracy and consistency of data.  
- **Data Security:** Provides controlled access via user permissions.  
- **Efficient Retrieval:** Uses indexing and query optimization for faster results.  
- **Reduced Redundancy:** Minimizes duplicate data through normalization.  
- **Backup & Recovery:** Supports automatic backup and restoration.  
- **Concurrent Access:** Enables multiple users to work simultaneously without conflicts.  

**Applications of DBMS:**
- **Banking:** Account management, transaction processing.  
- **E-commerce:** Product catalogs, order tracking, customer data.  
- **Healthcare:** Patient records, diagnosis history.  
- **Education:** Student grades, schedules, course management.  
- **Social Media:** User profiles, interactions, content storage.  
- **Data Science:** Storing and processing large datasets for analytics and predictions.

**Q2: What are the problems with traditional file-based systems?**

**Answer:**
Before the introduction of modern DBMS, data was stored and managed using basic file systems on hard drives. Although these systems allowed storing, retrieving, and updating files, they had several drawbacks:

- **Data Redundancy:** Duplicate entries often existed across multiple files.  
- **Data Inconsistency:** Conflicting or outdated information could occur due to redundant storage.  
- **Difficult Data Access:** Manual searching was time-consuming and inefficient.  
- **Poor Security:** No built-in access control to restrict unauthorized access.  
- **Single-User Limitation:** No support for multi-user collaboration.  
- **No Backup & Recovery:** Data loss was often permanent without recovery mechanisms.

**Q3: What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?**

**Answer:**
- **DBMS (Database Management System):**  
  A software system that enables users to create, store, modify, and delete data. It does **not** require a relational structure for organizing data.  
  *Examples:* Microsoft Access, XML databases.

- **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):**  
  A type of DBMS that stores data in structured **tables (relations)** and supports relational operations like **joins**. It enforces **data integrity** using primary keys and foreign keys, and supports SQL for querying.  
  *Examples:* MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

**Q4: What is the difference between File System and DBMS?**

**Answer:**

| Aspect                | File System | DBMS |
|-----------------------|-------------|------|
| **Data Storage**      | Stores data in separate files without structured relationships. | Stores data in a structured format (tables, objects) with relationships. |
| **Data Redundancy**   | High redundancy due to duplicate records in multiple files. | Redundancy minimized through normalization. |
| **Data Consistency**  | Inconsistencies common due to lack of centralized control. | Maintains consistency via integrity constraints. |
| **Data Access**       | Manual searching; slow for large datasets. | Uses query languages (e.g., SQL) for efficient retrieval. |
| **Security**          | Limited or no built-in access control. | Role-based permissions and authentication mechanisms. |
| **Multi-user Support**| Typically single-user; difficult for concurrent access. | Supports concurrent multi-user operations with concurrency control. |
| **Backup & Recovery** | No automatic backup/recovery; data loss may be permanent. | Provides built-in backup and recovery mechanisms. |
| **Data Integrity**    | No enforcement of data validation rules. | Enforces integrity via constraints (primary key, foreign key, etc.). |
